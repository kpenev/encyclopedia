Dear Kaloyan,

I am a section editor for a substantial endeavour, the production of Elsevier's
Encyclopedia of Astrophysics, 1st Edition, which aims to provide the first entry
point for undergraduate and postgraduate students and early career researchers
to the field.

In the section which encompasses exoplanetary systems and the solar system, I
feel that the following very important exoplanet-focussed topic needs to be
represented as a chapter: "Main-sequence systems: tidal evolution", which would
also include the more tangential topics of obliquity resonances and exo-moon
tides. Based on your expertise, I think you would be particularly well-suited to
write this chapter, and I'm delighted to invite you to do so. 

For perspective, another chapter is on main-sequence orbital stability, and I
don't wish there to be much overlap between the two. Also, there will be a few
chapters on formation in protoplanetary disks, but again I am planning for all
of the chapters to be mostly mutually exclusive.

Below you will find more details. After reading through these, please let me
know if you accept my invitation by October 9th. If I don't receive a response
from you by that date, then I will have to invite somebody else to write this
chapter.

Of course, I am happy to answer any questions you have, and I very much hope to
have you on board! Please let me know.

Cheers,
Dimitri Veras

- The chapter should be around 10,000 words including tables and references;
  there should be no more than about 30 references. Please keep in mind that the
  chapter should be written at the advanced undergraduate level, and not for
  experienced colleagues. As far as review articles go, 10,000 words is
  relatively short.

- You will be allowed to post your article to arXiv prior to publication (if you
  wish) as long as you insert a metadata comment that the document will be a
  chapter for the Encyclopedia of Astrophysics. 

- Your nominal writing time will be 4 months, but the editorial board will be
  flexible if needed. Please let me know if you would require alternate
  arrangements.

- The encyclopedia will be published both in print and online by Elsevier, who
  has published similar encyclopedias in other science fields [e.g. Encyclopedia
  of Modern Optics in 2004, Encyclopedia of Condensed Matter Physics in 2005,
  Comprehensive Biomedical Physics in 2014], but never yet in astrophysics and
  planetary science. The Editor-in-Chief of this encyclopedia is Ilya Mandel.

- Although there are obviously no astrophysics or planetary science chapters
  yet, the closest type of "sample chapter" I could share with you can be found
  here, from the Encyclopedia of Condensed Matter Physics:
  https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/people/veras/SampleChapter.pdf.
  You will be forging your own style.

- Required elements of the chapter would be (i) a title, (ii) a 100-150 word
  abstract, (iii) 5-10 keywords from https://astrothesaurus.org/, (iv) an
  outline/table of contents, (v) a glossary/nomenclature section or sections,
  (vi) a listing of objectives or learning objectives, (vii) an Introduction
  section, (viii) body text sectioned according to your choosing, (ix) a
  Conclusion section, (x) a References/Further Information section or sections,
  and (xi) figures. You can also optionally include multimedia, equations,
  tables, reference data or a graphical abstract if you wish.

Dear Kaloyan,

Thanks very much for your positive response, and I'm very pleased that you are
willing to write this article.

With regard to your good questions, yes, I do have a plan: I am in charge of one
of five sections of the encyclopedia, and my section covers both the solar
system and exoplanetary systems. One of the other sections is devoted to stars
only, where undoubtedly there will be some discussion about tides, although such
discussion may not be easy for readers to readily locate. Hence, please write
your chapter in a self-contained way, assuming that the reader has not read any
of stars chapters.

I'm trying to minimize overlap within only my section, which is subdivided into
four subsections: (1) Solar system, (2) Exoplanetary system formation, (3)
Exoplanetary system detection, and (4) Exoplanetary system evolution and death.
Your chapter falls under this last subsection, which will contain a total of 7
chapters:

- Main-sequence systems: orbital stability

- Main-sequence systems: tidal evolution

- Giant branch systems: surveys and populations

- Giant branch systems: dynamical and radiative evolution
  
- White dwarf systems: exoplanets and debris disks

- White dwarf systems: small body ingestion and chemistry

- Pulsar planetary systems

I'm asking you to write the second of these chapters. I've set it as an
individual chapter because planet-star tides along the main-sequence play such a
crucial role in determining the evolution of the abundance of close-in
exoplanets that we currently observe, and quite likely represents the primary
cause of planetary death; undergraduates need to know the importance of and
understand this effect. 

I've asked the potential author of the "Main-sequence systems: orbital
stability" chapter to not include tides at all so that there is no overlap with
your chapter. Also, I've asked the potential author of the "Giant branch
systems: dynamical and radiative evolution" chapter to definitely include tides
in their chapter, but only for giant branch planetary systems, so there is no
overlap with your chapter (and tides would only be a small part of that chapter
because there are many other effects which need to be covered).  A couple solar
system chapters will include tides when necessary, but will be almost entirely
restricted to moon-planet tides.

I hope all of that context helps narrow down the potential tidal topics to cover
in your chapter, and what I'm aiming for. That said, you will have the freedom
to go into as much depth as you feel is appropriate for the audience, because
you a true expert in this field.

Now I will put you in contact with the "Content Project Manager" (handling
editor) Snehil Sharma and "Assistant Content Project Manager" Rajeswari R, who
will send you the chapter template as well as a "welcome package", which likely
will repeat many of the details that I have already provided. I will send this
message from my gmail address (dveras@gmail.com), which you should feel free to
use from now on. They will send their messages from either address
MRW-EAST@elsevier.com or s.sharma4@elsevier.com [you might wish to take a note
of them in case the messages go to your spam folder]

If you have further questions, feel free to ask at any time. I look forward to
working with you!

Cheers,
-Dimitri
