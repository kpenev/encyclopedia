\section{Conclusions}
%
Research aiming to understand and model tidal interactions has entered a period
of renewed interest. This is mostly driven by the discovery of thousands of
exoplanets in short orbital periods which experience strong star-planet
interactions. Serendipitously, the same space- and ground-based surveys that
detect exoplanets also provide vast amounts of new data which can be used to
probe tidal friction and other tidal processes. This includes the exoplanet
systems themselves as described in this chapter, but also a wealth of binary
star systems in short period orbits which are characterized with orders of
magnitude higher precision than was previously available. Furthermore, the
increasing availability of computing resources allows ever more sophisticated
direct simulations of aspects of tidal interactions under ever more realistic
conditions. Thus the extremely active field of exoplanets simultaneously drives
interest and provides new data to study tidal interactions and this couples very
favorably with increased computing capacity to suggest that the renewed interest
in tides will continue and possibly intensify in the near future.
